# Sumerian-Letter
Translation of a response by Judith Deschamps to a Sumerian letter by Lu'enna.

Judith's response (in English) is found here. The response (in Sumerian and cuneiform) is found in the notebook in this repository and can be edited. 

To Louenna,
high priest of Ninmar:

 

Thank you. 

I discovered your letter in the Louvres,

and it touched me a lot.

I write you to tell you 

that you do not have to worry.

Your word,

even if Time and Men transformed it,

arrived to us.

It is the holes in the middle of its meaning, 
that for me, 

communicate the most.

Language is made of errors and misunderstandings.
Look at my letter:
Sumerian is totally unknown to me,
I never write on clay,
and I work with other tools than yours.
My words are necessarily inaccurate.
And without this fragility, 

how would we be able to communicate?


Shall this message,
in Ninmar,
reach you.

 

Judith Deschamps,
